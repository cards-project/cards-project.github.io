This is the beginning of The CARDS Project, a continuing project of the Portland Creative Coders community to publish hand-held works of generative art. The first series will be an edition of 150 "packs" of ten cards. Each pack will contain a unique iteration of the work of each of the ten featured artists. Among all the sets of cards no 2 images will be the same.
